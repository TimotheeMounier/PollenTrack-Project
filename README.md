# PollenTrack-Project
PollenTrack is a pollen sensor project developed as part of the engineering projects at our school.  This repo focus on hardware. All parts are designed to be easily printed or laser cut by beginners.

## Mechanical CAD


### Printed parts

All 3D printed parts are in `.stl` format. 

* **Walls**: These are the walls of the box that we build which are composed of the different elements.
* **Start adhesive tape**: The  start adhesive tape is composed of component you need to unwrap the adhesive tape.
* **Interface Indoor Outdoor**: This include the handle of our box and the LED interface
* **Sensing Part**: The sensing part is composed of a chimney which allows the fixation of a fan. An other piece piece like a funnel has been realized in oder to focus the pollen and maintain the adhesive tape
* **Motorization**: Motorization includes pieces which are necessary for the wrap of the adhesive tape. Ref Motor :NEMA 17HS4401 (3D print motor)

### Printer settings

Tested settings, but feel free to adapt them to your printer and material.:

* Layer height: 0.2mm
* Infill: 30%
* Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm
* Material: ASA to Interface and sensing part / PETG for the others

  
## Laser Cutting

* **Box**: It contains the scheme of the box that you can cut with a laser.

Laser cut parts are in `.svg` format. Red lines width is 0.2mm and are adapted for [Trotec Speedy 100](https://www.troteclaser.com/static/pdf/speedy-100/Fiche-technique-Speedy-100C-8063-fr.pdf) laser cutter.
Material: 6mm plywood recommended.
