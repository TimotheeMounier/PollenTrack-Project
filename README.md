# PollenTrack-Project
PollenTrack is a pollen sensor project developed as part of the engineering projects at our school.  This repo focus on hardware. All parts are designed to be easily printed or laser cut by beginners.

## Mechanical CAD

* **Walls**: These are the walls of the box that we build which are composed of the different elements.
* **Tape adhesive Start**: The tape adhesive start is composed of component you need to unwrap the adhesive tape.
* **Interface Indoor Outdoor**: This include the handle of our box and the LED interface
* **Sensing Part**: The sensing part is composed of a chimney which allows the fixation of a fan. An other piece piece like a funnel has been realized in oder to focus the pollen and maintain the adhesive tape

## Laser Cutting

* **Box**: It contains the scheme of the box that you can cut with a laser.
